My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.',\n",

out of 5 stars i generally like this product its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music setting timers and making calls reason why i didnt rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the

the music', 'i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account  i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc  i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never rememberi like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries', 'this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better thank you', 'during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i couldnt resist this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i couldnt be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job

add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is

user friendly', 'really disappointed alexa has to be plugin to wall socket all the time  my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery  if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa', 'i dont think the 342nd gen34 sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why wouldnt you just get a dot  2nd issue is which isnt unique to this unit but i dont understand why i cant override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a 34group34  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker', 'everything', 'i like the interaction of asking questions i don’t like that i can’t ask her to

my whole family', 'enjoyed entire echo experience', 'easy to set up', 'the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasnt  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done  however i cant make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best im happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit

surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely  handy', 'easy to setup love all the things she does', 'have alexa throughout the

music setting alarms answering questions etc its not the lifechanging home device amazon would have you believe but it is convenient to have around this refurb saved me a few bucks looks and works the same as the other brandnew ones', 'love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo it is awesome have used it for everything my lights since i work nights and

have to reset it i dont know if its because its refurbished but its okay its just not what i expected', 'so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not 100 know why it was there asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in but that was not the case took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed', 'it arrived quickly and was easy to set up  it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected  alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant', 'works as advertised speak clearly and research the commands also get the wall holder it keeps it out of the way set up is a breeze just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone for some reason

kitchenliving room and got this for my bedroom but there’s a significant difference in sound the dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker i was really disappointed i returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also', 'took me awhile to get it connected im not electronically savy but now that it is i

another one', 'just like new no problems whatsoever alexa thank you', 'i like my uncle but sometime it goes a little haywire', 'bought this for my son and it didn’t work he had to return it', 'bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months hard and soft reset will not fix the problem', 'i received my echo dot today in good condition but be advised i paid 2999 for it and amazon has as of this writing raised the price to 3999 so do your research before buying so you can get a good dealset up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in follow the app instructions except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i’ve been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spieli’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time as wellall that said when alexa works she works amazingly well i don’t have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers music podcasts etc the “hey siri” feature is all but useless alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet so i’m not sure if this will continue to hold truesetting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil and if you have special settings for your led devices eg rainbow effects alexa can’t handle them she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levelsall in all my rating would’ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problems persist i may have to exchangereturn this item i don’t want to though — alexa’s kind of growing on me', 'i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume was not loud enough for me

least not in my home', 'very bad this device i don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself  nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking when you talk you

effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and couldnt be happier walk through the door and just ask alexa to 34play 80s music34 and viola instant atmosphere no more opening the ipad going to settings turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app it just makes things so effortless

them now  one new one refurbished  both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things  i love it as an alarm every morning or whenever  i love it to play music or sounds of the ocean or

the top line with video music etc  i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even

connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone the app works perfectly fine and it lets you add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is great and modern it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if youd like as

give me more flexibility the alexa', 'i dont think the 342nd gen34 sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why wouldnt you just get a dot  2nd issue is which isnt unique to this unit but i dont understand why i cant override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a 34group34  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker', 'everything',

thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe it’s a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too', 'like everything about it the music the trivia games the weather', 'as described and received on time  do not like automatic enrolment into music', 'a great device', 'i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since english is her second

discovering all that the echo can do', 'amazing paroduct', 'good hearing range and sound quality it was a bit complicated to set up and she doesnt quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system', 'speaker sounds good', 'absolutely love', 'the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house  there isn’t anything i dislike', 'were thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo installation was easy using the alexa app i purchased 2 kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights installation again was easy using the kasa app they sinqued right up with the echo were enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome weve added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen setup was seamless were looking forward to adding more automation to our home', 'home entertainment', 'very cool product easy to setup fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated', 'love these  great sound easy to connect and use', 'doesnt work with my fairly new smart tv but thats mainly the tv manufacturerslg fault due to not supporting

you so much', 'i am extremely impressed with this item bought it from the 34warehouse34 or 34outlet34 with a 34minor imperfection cant tell it even has one works great didnt come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasnt missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it its not a bose but its more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescant wait to get for my classroom too its a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it', 'i love my echo show  and now i have this in my bedroom and its wonderful music info sleeping sounds', 'awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her 34wake34me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will 34listen34 to what i say i love both my echos dont hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa', 'i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she wouldnt play anything she isnt smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we cant use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure ill ever use my alexa again', 'i like everything about it', 'liked 100', 'never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new just read the comment to see why it is used', 'our family really loves this new echo', 'bought for my wife she loves it', 'fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house', 'like it to do more',

to music answer quick questions alarms to wake up for school etc', 'listen music and set timer', 'i received the echo in perfect condition the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues alexa is a great addition to our family', 'good sound like it for music and scheduling like that i can get random thoughts recorded while i think about them the jokes are cute',

more about other options it provides', 'this echo is just as great as my others even though it is smaller', 'funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home  loving it', 'i bought this to replace a 34dot34 in my living room speaker is slightly better it hears me better over the tv unfortunately it doesnt understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request i dont consider it an upgrade', 'i have had all good experience so far with the second generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now i am mostly enjoying the music weather updates using the alarm feature and her personality i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes i am very excited to begin using them', 'i’m having trouble connecting my tv to it but i’m not exactly tech smart i’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me so far i’ve been using it mostly for music', 'simply love my echo i hardly watch any tv at all anymore im too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family', 'enjoyed entire echo experience', 'easy to set up', 'the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasnt  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done  however i cant make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best im happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit would be great to have updates to our little ais i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you', 'very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered', 'i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely  handy', 'easy to setup love all the things she does', 'have alexa throughout the housethe future has arrived', 'i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and couldnt be happier', 'arrived as expected', 'bought this a few weeks ago   everything about this product is excellent  dont forget to buy a charger when ordering its a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard', 'terrific', 'love my echo', 'it’s smaller than the original looks nicer too', 'works great', 'my husband and i are what i would call 34late adopters34 when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source  wow were we amazed and the great sound  weve also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa  i may even buy one for my elderly dad  i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us', 'i really have enjoyed it  changing the directv channels plays iheartradio and pandora  adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights', 'i have been wanting one of these for a while now  bought on prime day and absolutely love it', 'we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously pandora integration is another feature that i use daily so happy with out prime day purchase i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future', 'see subject line  love it', 'love it', 'very easy setup', 'i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough the echo is the same except the sound quality which i really didnt feel i needed however i am so glad i got it what a difference the sound really is far superior to the echo dot now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power', 'sound quality is great still learning about all the different things i can do with it fun', 'got a good deal and works great with prime  setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service  has worked great with nice sound from

efficient and amazing  how cool  we all use it often every day', 'i’m impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has it’s definitely comparable to my bose mini i only gave 4 stars because i can’t use my apple music account', 'technology in such a small device the price was good too the sound is amazing a must have feature for any home', 'mainly use it for the music but i’m learning more all the time  really nothing bad to say about it', 'i replaced my 1st gen was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same soundi was wrong  if anything its the same volume and more clear  good

enjoyment and i just love it', 'easy to use and has great soundit was a great purchase at a great price', 'very easy to set up and have no issues', 'this unit add much pleasure to our echo plus  we now can have music and information through our home or just in one room', 'its extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesnt answer everything i ask but its still nice to use', 'too difficult to set up  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password', 'just getting use to using the echo used it for shopping lists listening to music and as a timer working great so far', 'very cool and lots of fun used for a week and still learning its capabilities', 'love it love it', 'love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps', 'i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information', 'its great for music a little hard to figure out how it works', 'this was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus it’s good for homework so i purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when i’m getting ready for work i listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock', 'very impressed with look clarity of sound and color', 'alexa is amazing great speaker', 'still getting used to alexa dont have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now use her for music and information which she is great', 'works and sounds great my house is barely 1100sf and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter i can hear it and speak to it from any room lots of functionality still to discover', 'i have had pure fun with my echo  weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for  a lot of fun for the money', 'use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home', 'love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off', 'bought this for my daughter when she turned 9  she loves it  i especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs  sometimes over and over and over again lol', 'we got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though', 'i am impressed with the sound quality', 'very pleased with my

the news prepare grocery lists and get great music', 'the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions', 'this is my second echo i have the dot but the speaker is weak so i purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great', 'great sound', 'great', 'we really only use this as a speaker to stream music we’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless', 'once set up very user friendly setup wasnt as user friendly as id hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing invasive  drivers my wife and i are both retired and she wouldnt have been able to install alexa but if my son wasnt supplying her with a smart phone we wouldnt be using alexa yet', 'very easy set up really enjoying it', 'the echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient', 'more compact and a bit better than the original', 'i love it pretty cool', 'i having it in my living room music sounds really good in my living room  i can hear it upstairs', 'this is a great product  set up was easy  sound is wonderful', 'so far i like it  i bought it just for some music though and it sounds pretty good', 'love it', 'love it', 'glad i bought this', 'like all types of funmusic and more', 'i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly', 'beyond my capabilities to

 have had it for about 10 days now and love it', 'great speaker with a lot of capabilities very fun to learn how to use it', 'i used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos', 'don’t use it for much as i thought we would synced with kasacam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot lyrics for music is cool too other than that it’s used as a clock and standard dot’ish features', 'amazing so far just got it the other day', 'i like that its smaller but it has never understood commands as easily as our firstgen original echo did', 'worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock  however for the price it should come with the stand', 'i love this device all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen it looks great on my nightstand as a clock lots of faces to choose from and displays weather reminders etc i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway it’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room i’m planning to get another one for my guest room awesome for a great price', 'i love the echo spot this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to “alexa” like the other devices in my home i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusioni named him “echo” now if i could only choose a male voice i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell so many more features don’t forget to buy thestandbase so many advantages to having that read the reviews highly recommend', 'i love this little spot more than i thought i would the sound is great for such a little thingmy music plays nice and loud and clear the video is terrifici was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it and i was really impressed immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthdayonly thing that kept me from giving it 5 starsi really wish it was cordless i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain and it won’t connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner of course if it was cordless i could just bring it with meotherwise i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one', 'i bought on prime day and so glad i did it’s easy to use and lots of customization options i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree', 'honestly i like it but at the same time i don’t i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it', 'overall its great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and  date however sometimes it freezes and doesnt respond properlyno error message about lack of connectivityit just stops resetting resolves the problem', 'i love all that you can do with the echo spot', 'the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature  you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo easy to use', 'love it perfect for an alarm clock replacement plus so much more', 'i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom', 'we absolutely love this product wish we would have bought this instead of the dots', 'we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly  you can even hear music played the speaker is clear  we are enjoying it  what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me  the next day i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song  the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before  it was a little disconcerting', 'i like echo spot i bought it to use as an alarm clock one negative that i didnt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better', 'this is our second echo spot  to go with out two echo dots  love the look and how alexia responds', 'love my echo spot', 'it is very slow compared to the echo', 'i love the way it is designed and you have choices for the face  i use it for my bed side  i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling', 'terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a squarerectangular screen', 'new to alexa like this spot a lot', 'its not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for 2 purposes first so i could set wakeup alarms by individual days and set the wakeup music individually by the day second i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plughas been able to accomplish that a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlistswhats not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai gets better in the future along with added functions', 'i love it  it is so easy to use', 'put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm works great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have', 'love it', 'part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless  though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones computers or ipads just not worth it', 'very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone', 'i love my new echo spot', 'i love this clock i just have to tell it to set my alarm  no more fussing with buttons', 'couldnt be more pleased amazon hit this one out of the park looks great and runs great love it', 'responds easily and like the ability to do at night', 'easy setup  love it', 'simply amazing what a awsome device it never ceases to amaze me wake up to big bang music go to sleep softly falling rain drop in on the kids and keep in touch i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do', 'i was skeptical at first but 34it34 grows on you  it looks good so far  i did however turn off the camera', 'sound quality is disappointing', 'i love it  i especially love that it is so small and does so much  got rid of my old cdalarm clock radio  much more room on nightstand', 'great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off', 'the ease to use product', 'so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clockradio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good', 'i am just entering the 34smart34 technology world i havent figured it all out yet but so far its pretty cool', 'it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs', 'love my echo spot', 'great deal great product', 'perfect', 'i had a couple of echo dots previously  bought these specifically for the ring doorbell video  cloud cam display  interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard  back yard  front door etcthe video chat with the other rooms is also quite coolbonus “alexa show me ant man trailer etc”i know this can all be done on laptopdesktop but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing', 'bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos  etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps 34alexa turn off lights34 love it', 'love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall i’m happy i have it would recommend', 'it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it', 'cool little piece of techwe’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential  even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter', 'i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device  alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future', 'as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products  unfortunately it doesnt go up from there  the ability to play videos is very limited  you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception  you cant turn off the 34things to try34 screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen  i dont need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things i can do with alexa  i dont need the advertising especially at the cost of this device  overall its an expensive alexa device with a screen thats not very useful and annoying  i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen thats actually useful', 'so far so good', 'this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at alloverall a great addition to my smart home its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn onoff the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone i have a bunch of other alexa devices but this was the first one with a screen', 'i love this thing i talk to it through walls and in other rooms i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i was ready for this when it came out the screen is just so nice to havethe only thing resembling a down side is that it doesnt always perfectly understand which song i want to hear but i do have a deep southern accent lower alabama so i dont speak english anyways', 'smaller than i thought it would be happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table', 'echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready  unfortunately that is not case  perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated', 'nice', 'i like it', 'weve owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool  other than playing music through a sound system we havent found much use for them  we just dont find the voice user interface to be all that efficient  the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that youre routinely interested in  furthermore you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings  we now use these as bedside clocks', 'i love my echo spot  waking to my favorite music  being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark  all the skills i have yet to try  easy to use', 'i like how small it is but i’m still able to see my ring cameras', 'great for checking in on my son after school when im still at work  love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so i can plan my route accordingly', 'love it super fun easy to use my three year old even gets involved', 'i returnef this item because it does not speak spanish', 'i am a hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot it’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch', 'love this', 'i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up', 'works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa doesnt work as well as the normal echo  sometimes alexa doesnt hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions  the speaker also isnt as good as the normal echo  screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing whos at the front door  but its great for the bedside', 'fun tech toy', 'love it small with good sound', 'with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device', 'great product', 'in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off', 'i love this device its so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and its dark in the roomother than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again', 'hands free control', 'great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday', 'it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent ive added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but its ridiculous that it cant access youtubeit might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often', 'setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock', 'great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the desk', 'eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring i don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 35 is about right i can’t connect to my spotify unless it’s premium and i’m in college and i’m not paying or that or amazon music so', 'i am huge amazon fan first to have a kindle and the echo i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile i do love it my kids love it they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can’t it’s spot to spot can’t even skype which i do often with my aunt the is my major disappointment with it', 'love love love these the only think i notice is that it doesnt pickup my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots we have 4 echo products throughout our house i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock im no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists', 'love my amazon products', 'love this', 'love my spot have that  a dot and a regular echo', 'nice upgrade from an echo dot', 'works decent wish it was able to answer more questionsneed a better source for info but the rest works great', 'i cant live without alexa', 'really like it the screen is a major plus', 'didnt think id get an alexa device but this is perfect for my home office  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the

allow video directly in your home the spot is not a device that can keep you safe', 'its fun to use and makes my life easier in some sense', 'love it', 'i got my echo spot on prime day and love it i think it still is a little expensive but the chance to save 30 convinced me to buy it i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly

this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it

15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it’s is great to be able to see him in between visits', 'i wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom  but the font is too small to see from any distance  and apparently you cant change it', 'great size for bedside plus it dims at night', 'i love it and it works great the only issue is the “drop in” facetime like feature sometimes lags but

know why i like it but i do its like an allinone alarm clock  if you have other alexa devices you know what it is  if you are looking to get an alarm clock this is the one to get yes its much more than that  it shows you the time it shows you the weather its touch screen it shows you music lyrics and it does all the things your typical alexa device does  its quite loud for its size as well

and easy to set up', 'i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement   the display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this taskthe display works well for camera viewingit is an attractive device and a decent value at 99', 'great device', 'i’m a fan of echo devices i think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep my two year old sleeps so much better with it on we also use it to tell my two year old stories only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night', 'i own 5 echo devices consider me addicted this little number is awesome not only do i like that it displays the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices one feature i really like is how it slowly dims after i turn off my bedroom light so i have

product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable1 there is a 34card34 on the homescreen called 34things to try34  its an ad for other alexa services you can try you can turn off all the other homescreen cards but not this one2 by default the homescreen cards 34cycle34 automatically which is incredibly annoying there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only 34cycle once34 instead of 34cycle continuously34 but critically this setting does not work my unit has been set to 34cycle once34 and the cards still continue to cycle all the time have rebooted the device reset etc etcuntil these two obvious software issues are fixed in my opinion the product is useless', 'great deal on prime day', 'no problem', 'excelente su funcionamiento y llama

cleaning ladies came through we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off while leaving the fan running only gripe would be the mic sensitivity which doesnt appear be as good as the view or gen2 it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself', 'this product has made my life much simpler with a little one i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it

it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures', 'fun so farstill learning how it all works', 'i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact i can honestly say i have no regrets while i probably wouldn’t watch a movie i’d been dying to see on this it’s a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching “jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it wasn’t as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend', 'we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed', 'it was easy set up  i use it more than i thought', 'i would

fantastic playlist for cleaning  from reading books to my five year old to video chat to silly selfies music that automatically goes to my bose bluetooth speaker setting timers alarms changing my

saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast  the spot changes everything as far as keeping your loved ones connectedwell worth every cent', 'all is fine with the spot exact for one massive failing  in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk  which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like  yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarmthis is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off  but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still havent adding this setting clearly not going to happen  this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made', 'excellent', 'item

minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the nest app', 'would be 5 stars if you could turn off the 34things to try34 screen  i should have read up on this before buying the spot  amazon please update to enable us to turn this off  it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see 34things to try34', 'love it so great to use', 'i own 3 of these  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool  you can customize the screen contents but you cannot turn off there advertising things to try  people will suggest that you can but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable optionmoreover they should increase the size slightly and improve the audio speaker  that would give you a 5 star deviceright now

day and fell in love  i have one in my office and one in our kitchen  i have already used this for morning briefings from the news while i am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes  the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing this was a concern for me  i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools  note i did purchase camera covers even though there is a button to 34turn off the camera and microphone34 and it doesnt impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about there are work around', 'love love love this  i have an echo and several echo dots but love the video with this and the clock  i no

stand', 'love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual i dont have hours to research websites plus more instruction from alexa on skills would be great we often get the answer i dont know that skill even though ive added it in the app ie kwikset or pizza hut', 'such a handy item to have on my night stand she reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views', 'i got this on prime day and figured id see what all the hype is about  honestly i didnt really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly i love it  like it or not this is the way the world is going so why noti loved it so much i ordered 2  i didnt get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990s and is downright ugly  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spots screen does not bother me  although it is very clearalexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where its hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar  where i can just say play any song i want and it will  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you dont know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pagesthe one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much  they also do not rotate when playing music  id love for it to display the weather as i listen to musicthe screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be  there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents  and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic  i have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work  so it really works greatthe one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot  the dot lights up colors  why cant the spot   the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for deliveryoverall its a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around  im already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc and  when i become a home owner instead of renting where i cant tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration', 'the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also it’s not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option  i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds', 'love it', 'i looooooove this thing  watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen but other than that

replace a dot in my bedroom already have a show and a couple of fullsized echo units in my housethe spot is okay for what it is two issues one minor and one majorthe minor one  why include the huge bezel on the front why not take that space and make the display larger a total waste of usable spacethe major one also involves the show im very used to these devices i dont need to see 34things to try34 whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices im not a child and i dont need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why doesnt amazon fix this and give us

here is greater than google im using to listen to free music with prime better than alternatives audible and you can even watch movies the display is a little small for lots of watching the sound should be louder and youtube needs to be available these issues put this at a 35 to 4 stars fix one of them youtube and its a 5 star item to alleviate sound ive paired with a blue tooth speaker right

to replace a sony dash remember those after sony decided to pull support from it entirely it works great for what i use it for an alarm clock a weather station background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you cant turn off the suggestions on 34things to try34 it s an annoying and a stupid design

the home screen the home screen is just the time i spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail i am disappointed because i wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate i am hoping they will do something about this other than that it’s great', 'the product is attractive and somewhat useful but amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and trending”  this greatly depreciates the value of the product  do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from amazon', 'the echo spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient it reminds me of any appointments warns me about traffic snarls and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists', 'come on  its amaonmazing  its way more than a smart speaker  its my wakeup alarm my security blanket and infotainment center allinone  its my connection to the world during night hours when

have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy the round screen is an interesting choice and im not sure i like the look but it is growing on me the speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product', 'its not as good as siri but it still has some positives its great at playing music and setting alarms i personally felt that i paid too much for this product as it was nearly half off on prime day literally the day after i purchased it so im pretty disappointed i might still return it and get my money back', 'having received this as a gift i am writing my initial thoughts compared to my google home minipros  way easier to setup than the google home mini  i was able to connect all of my smart home device unlike google without any issues  making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand mecons  need to enable skills to get more functionality  google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions

have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it’s very comfortable for the eyes easy set up love it', 'got it and as expected its great almost a swell as my show', 'love this thing people think i’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock but i don’t care for me waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it so glad i

absolutely love this very user friendly and i got the kasa cam to go with it to monitor my living room super easy to set up and operate i only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately i’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces i like digital but i miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them i’d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices i really have no complaints i’m being nit picky at this point worth every penny', 'surprisingly good beefy sound out of this

lived without it so long if you can’t decide whether to buy it or not go for it you won’t regret it', 'fairly useless', 'bought the spot and loved it within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating i was told to unplug and technical support would call within 2448 hours waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions told to wait longer really  unacceptable—expected more from amazon find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance', 'much easier to use than the dot it picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding the screen is a nice perk but i only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed the screen is too small to watch showsit displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures  my only complaint is that they dont add the stand as standard i didnt need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bedmany people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that im not going to split hairs  the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot  alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice i think amazon is working overtime on this project i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anythingi am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when im staying in a hotel and shes no where to be found  alexa what time is it  alexa', 'when we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra 30so we thought why not well im so glad we did we are really enjoying our echo spot it

6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video  much of the time it works well as alarm clock but there are some serious flaws particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake  it doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having alexa repeat “ok alarm set for 5am”  not good  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid  plain and simple this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone  no thanks if i’m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i’m in the shower', 'i bought this for my mother and she loves it i want to get one for myself now', 'invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to creapy af', '4 out of 5 stars i have the original tall echo 4 dots 2 spots and 1 show  the only thing im finding a problem with is the speakers in the spot when using drop in  sometimes im not being heard on the other spot and vice versa  the voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent the optical is fine its just the sound sometimes ill have to repeat the wake word 23 times and im only 8 feet away plus its on one of those 20 stands  i find the echo dot original echo and the show has much better sound quality  thats one reason i bought the echo show', 'i bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and i love it she can call all her family members with just her voice play games even watch a video and i love that i can “drop in” on her any time to see how she is doing she lives all by herself and i feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to alexa for help', 'i love this thing it plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms if you’re considering purchasing

day it even goes right into my favorite podcast while i get dressed', 'works replaced my expired bedside radioalarmit took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch

how i desired an assistant when i came across the spot  as a mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules  my own i just verbally tell alexa what reminder or timer i need set and voilahaving my spot has given me the virtual assistant i so desired without having to actually hire someone  not to mention the many other awesome features i have alexa synced

the line however i sooooo love my sleek little sopt', 'i love the product  but very disappointed once i  realized i can no longer play youtube videos  im now past my 30 days return date  i am

asking me about this purchase i got it as a gift from my kids for mother’s day  it was not bought from my account lil bit creepy  i haven’t really had much use for it as no one calls they text so that part meh the other things it does are no different than the other alexa products', 'i love love love love it  i feel like i have a talking computer that tells me everything', 'love the echo show  being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful', 'it seems to work well  unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because as many have mentioned it does not work with google or youtube any more  this problem is caused by google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these  this even effected my smart tv  anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so well see what happens when we hand them out', 'love listening to music still trying to learn everything it does', 'very pleasedsimple to figure out', 'just what i expectedalready have 2 other  shows', 'very good', 'excellent to listen to my music my audio books and look

know what i was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can’t dhiw u what’s recording hmm', 'used for personal use we like hearing weather news from cnn and various playlists', 'love it', 'i like the echo show its the best big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it', 'prime day pricing was good but the show is very limited  no video services available except amazon video  no netflix or youtube  alexa is very limited also not nearly as useful as google', 'works great has great picture easy to setup and use', 'the fact that she can help me find my phone when i am at home alone is worth the price of this device', 'i love this item i underestimated this item i have another 2 in my cart  but im waiting for the same deal again i highly recommend this item', 'i love using my echo show for music it sounds amazing unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great my husband and i video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated im still learning to use it but so far so good', 'love it', 'oh i love my echo show and the video news spots', 'waste of money over the echo generation 2  you don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on facetime or skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do i have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution  i have also had problems with this device shutting down and i have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices  price difference is just not worth it', 'no you tube wouldnt have bought it if i known that', 'this is our second echo show  we have a home in mexico and one in the usa  now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other  we can also drop in on the houses when we aren’t there to check on them  we use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes  we also have echo dots in various rooms  we love all this technology  we ask her many questions and she plays music for us', 'needs to play youtube and prime video and maybe netflix but it has good sound', 'we love our echo show', 'great product', 'i love this device i upgraded from the echo spot i just wish i could customize the clock on my screen to analog to mimic what i was used to in the echo spot also there is better sound quality on this device', 'love this thing best toy ive bought myself in awhile so far i have a smart plug connected running my ac  and the wifi light bulbs  baseball scores weather are  cool but the music is the best feature', 'this thing is a lot cooler than i thought it would be  i mostly have used it to read me audiobooks but i also love that i can see into the camera while im at work', 'i’m really enjoying this product love the flash briefing the timers the weather reports and more', 'we love the show  it loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an show issue or our internet issue  but overall we use it for many applications',

exactly how you would expect right out of the box i love being able to not only hear but now see what i need on this device i loved my regular echo but the show is just so much better  it works wonderfully for music especially paired with the amazon music account and is perfect with my ring doorbell love it', 'i absolutely love this  i have it in my kitchen so i can use it for cooking the speakers are amazing', 'ive only had this a week but so far so good  we are enjoying it', 'love the product idea super easy to set up  get started a breeze to do routine tasks set alarms timers add items to shoppingto do lists play music get news just about anything its supposed to do the sound is good where imhave it sitting not tinny at all as some have found there is one thing i hate  it would keep me from recommending it to anyone  you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask alexa unless you have her turn off the screen totally which i do when i go to bed and its too bad bc its like a continuously running advertisement or setup guide not attractive the echo show was on sale prior to prime day for less than the echo so i figured i was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with because of the ever present script its not a nice device to look at i would not buy it again or recommend  go with the echo i may still exchange the product', 'very excited to see what it can do', 'this is great for music video calling kitchen timers and probably a bunch more the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the everfloating things to try on the home screen this is purely an aesthetic complaint but hopefully soon amazon allows the option to shut it off', 'i love the idea is the star trek computer at home the skills are great but the natural language work is mediocre', 'got this as a gift so cool  i can view my news recipes or shopping lists  and much more', 'i do love it was easy to set up so far but i wish it has a little more in the set up instructions there is still a whole lot more i would like to be able to do with it and i have no idea if i can or not with it

echo gen 1 and echo gen 2 and a dot they all do a far better job of voice recognition that the echo show  in fact it is so bad that it is virtually useless  also the speaker is incredibly bass heavyso much so that it is hard to understand voices  ive worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble but it still sounds awful  finally the screen just doesnt add much  i cant see if from across the room it rarely activates in any meaningful way and when it doesnt it is more of a distraction than a helpusing facetime is so much more practicalthan using the show im surprised amazon didnt make this a little more useful than it is  perhaps in the future but for now it is a waste of time and money', 'i love it it does everything', 'thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality not much better than the echo dot not worth the money', 'i purchased echo about 2 weeks ago  i love this product i would definitely recommend', 'im loving my new echo show the video screen adds so much more value and potential movies tv shows song lyrics all extra features that are available with the echo show oh it also has a built in camera for taking pics', 'my wife has been using skype for years to talk to her parents daily with constant technical issues  since her father is 88 its a lot to ask the man to uninstallreinstallreconfigure skype but he does  when i saw these

set up quickly and worked fine with no issues  my wife told her coworker today and she went out and bought 3  one for herself and her husband and one for each set of parents  it just works like a telephone  imagine that', 'bluetooth sound is great videos are crazy it’s an amazing device', 'great item for knowledge directions musiclaughter and more', 'very niceneeds some work', 'very cool',

thought i could have the weather for an area displayed continuously  but i have to talk to alexa which i dont want to do in the middle of the night had i payed full price it would have been returned there are other features that are nice but i may never use them', 'we held off purchasing an echo but couldnt resist during prime days  the echo works great and its nice to have the screen  there is still a lot more we need to learn how to do', 'love it very much still learning everything that my echo can do but am really enjoying the whole process', 'love it still learning all the possibilities', 'i love the echo show awesome speakers i love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far also being able to read whats on your shopping list to do list and notifications', 'nice works great', 'easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do  just awesome', 'met every expectation i had', 'i like it', 'unit is working great but it is a true pia that products today are shipped without user manuals do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased i have no idea of the echo shows capabilities i have it linked to my hue lights but have no idea what commands will work and what wont i purchased a fire tv stick along with the show but have no idea how to maximize the two just a few examplesi even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful seems way too basic to me but better than a kick in the pants', 'its a fun item to have  has a lot of udefulness  big negative is that it doesnt use google or any real search engine to get answers or find information', 'i was pleasantly surprised it’s awesome so far', 'alexa show is amazing my wife hated that i bought it thought we didnt need it and after a day she fell in love with alexa too lol it is so convenient for setting timers listening to music playing music for the dog while im not home connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties playing movies i love it', 'do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either  it rarely gets what i say correct does not control the dish receiver  yes i set it up correctly using the alexa app on my phone  we got this for 129  which is a good deal ti is definately not worth the 229 price though  maybe in another month it will get better or either i have one that is just deaf and dumb  really can not recommend this item at the current time', 'it makes talking with your grandchildren so easy especially for the little ones  outstanding product', 'great product', 'i already had purchased the echo and a couple of dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped  i am very glad i did  the versatility of the video screen is outstanding  no regrets', 'i purchased the show  to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country  it is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations', 'my difficulty is i dont have a cell phoneand now you cant download the alexa app on a mac book air  so i am stuck unable to program my echo show properly in my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done and the echo show does it every time i ask for something i am referred back to the alexa appon your mobile device which i cannot accessto me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to functionevery thing today is pushed to the phone  because the phone has been made accessable  to all those who wish  to gather information', 'great in the kitchen  i love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes  also great for listening to music and watching shows on amazon prime video while i cook  i subsequently bought an echo dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom  i created a group so i can play music on both of them at the same time  i plan to add more speakers in the future', 'excellent quality very good sound great deal on prime day', 'so far so good  neat to have a visual version of alexas responses nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to  flash briefings have good videos

the timer setting it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to and i love shopping list feature  my family enjoys the games too it’s made my life a little more easy alexa is my

finding new ways to use it the longer we have it', 'i have been through 4 shows now  and all of them have been broken  it has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders  i dont have these issues on my dot or my echo  just on the show  it would be nice if amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing', 'easy set up', 'pleased with the echo it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions', 'love it  great to request

up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good', 'works on great i  use it with my arlo security system', 'this is so fun i really enjoy using it i have it hooked up to one of my lights so i just tell alexa when i want that on and off also it connects to my spotify so i just have alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended i feel like theres even more i can do with this so im excited to use it more', 'upgraded from an original echo on prime day and so far i love it im sure i have a long way to go to maximize its utility  but for now i owe my marked increase in

'i love the echo show i’m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense we carry devices with cameras all the time the only difference here is that the item is stationary my family and i also find the dropin feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy it’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versai’d also like to thank amazon for including their voiceview screen reader on the device the show would be a lot less blind friendly even with alexa present if they hadn’t included thatwe are an echoloving household with two dots three echos and now two shows i wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones thanks amazon', 'i love it it is awesome', 'very good to be able to listen to every single song at any time in amazons vast library were only just beginning to know

see my canary cameras and that’s exactly what i wanted i have been happy with all my alexa’s because we have several and this is a great addition', 'i really love this item  so much fun', 'i agree youtube should be on there', 'we like it a lot sound is better than the original echo the bass feels deeper  the screen is cool though havent got a lot of use out of it though', 'good sound the capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home', 'great addition to the alexa family just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds dont get me wrong i dont regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of 100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking', 'ive had previous experience with the echo dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the waterits great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud', 'love the echo show can keep i can video chat with the kids and grandkids i have it in the kitchen so when i run out of something i have alexa to add it to my grocery list i use it for everything was very easy to set up', 'i’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the

it l i plan on getting an echo for the kitchen', 'it does not pick up my voice unless i yell most times', 'great love it', 'amazing', 'fire hd does so much more  over priced pair of speakers', 'seems

exactly as i should', 'upgraded from echo to echo show', 'i love the echo show i have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months  but the show is so much better  the sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4k tv  i love being able to see my timers events and list instead of having them read to me  i purchased this on prime day and it is worth every penny  when the dot was given to me i thought this is a cute novelty  but ill probably never use it was i wrong  echo is part of my daily routine  and has made my life so much easier', 'so far i’m very pleased with my echo show  the problem is there’s so much it can do that i haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities i got the special price as part of the prime day promotionand you just can’t beat what you get for the price  very pleased with the sound the video screen is sharp sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a commandbut as i get to know the system better i’m hoping that will improve  one drawback in the musici’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past are rerecordings by the original artistbut not the original recording itself  example secret agent man by johnny riversa “live”version is used not the original version  if i’m going to pay for prime musici’d like to hear the original version of songsnot later recordings  or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear  otherwise i am very pleased with my echo show  so pleased in fact that i bought a second one', 'i like everything about this  im still learning how to use it', 'its like having another kid in the house i have to constantly repeat myselfi can tell alexa to do something clear as day and according to the history she hears something comeletely

displays in very small text it also always has a line that says 34tell alexa to do this or that34 tips at the bottom of the screen i would like to see that go away but it wont sound quality is good not as good as the big echo but good enough i bought it on sale and think i got value for what i paid i would have been disappointment had i of paid full price', 'love my echo show', 'i enjoy this thing its learning', 'am very happy now that i can see', 'all of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account asking any echo device to play music on sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly this went on for two weeks until i eventually solved the problem that neither amazon nor sonos could figure out', 'so far i like it  it is better than i expecting it', 'doesnt always respond to the wake word this is my 3rd echo product and i have to say i am a little disappointed alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries', 'good product', 'after two weeks i am not sure if i like the ever present alexa to have a screen as well  i bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera and that works  but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off  instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video  there is something about only audio that made alexa different no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to', 'it f sucks', 'love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs', 'this thing is awesome for grocery lists paired with the anylist app the flash briefing is very good too my only complaint is that once you pause something alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing forever all in all definitely worth the purchase',

access youtube as of dec 2017 i wasn’t aware of that when i purchased it i’ve had problems with my device the voice stops working throughout the day i can see it trying to respond to me because the window it opens contains the info i asked about but it’s like the device gets stuck in the process it stops working and the blue bar just flashes i keep having to unplug and restart the device once i do that it starts working again so irritating this device could really be a great device if google and amazon would act like grownups', 'returned from repair with no repair done it has a problem which

gets a real kick out of thati know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment but remember the original echo didnt have what it has now when it first came out i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon maybe even things we havent thought ofi do wish it was a bit more user friendly i still havent figured out how to video chat with my cousin in north carolina who also has one and when i tried to call my sons dot it went to video chat immediately last i looked dots dont have video screensanother thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free so now he is a bit worried to use it again that needs to be fixedi do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show', 'i have not had it

features are awesome the interaction is fantastic home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly my only issue is out of 4 echo shows 2 of them have been sent off for repair

update to the newest firmware for it to work again then 2 weeks later the glitch starts up againi love the show but i’m getting really frustrated with the glitching', 'super fun  i ty is what i was

is so far ahead of the competition', 'i bought this product hoping that alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along therefore expecting her to be responsive this 100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her echo buttons manual see step 3 the device has potential given it has a big screen decent sound but for 200 bucks i would never reccomend it even for the 100 i spent i feel like i got shorted oh and lastly the device is pretty useless without a prime membership i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker i went on the family account this one and got it to work minimal oh and even with our prime membership you have to have a music pass or something thats an extra 399 a month leaving this item a subscription nightmare and a overpriced decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes i would give it zero stars if i could', 'quite niceclear great sound', 'versatile use can

screen promoting all their alexa features  you can turn off many other things in settins but you cannot turn off 34things to try34  instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time  we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says 34try 34  amazon please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam', 'the best part about owning this is that

speaker whenif the party extends into the yard i have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices', 'we got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired  it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once i did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff  it should do text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he wouldnt feel left out and isolated  they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so tech support can help setup the device  i had to get a friend whos an it guy to come help me setup', 'i love every aspect of the echo plus i wanted it for my office the light was also for my desk lamp', 'great hub', 'this is very hard to review because i am part of the  problemi am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when i am not homei am computer literate itunes literate amazon literate as well as countless other programs but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to alexa  i think i heard her sigh in exasperationi tried to create a playlist of songs i like only to have it ignored  i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre at bestand as yet do not include a personal playlisti have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic alexa than am iso far i like what i have been able to use but id like it a lot more if i could configure it to my needs rather than accepting the amazonalexa defaultkaren', 'very satisfied with the purchase

smart bulbs are awesome', 'my new bff', 'alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked for example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money', 'for now i love everything so cool with my music and flash briefings 5 star echo', 'great product i have two and may want to buy a third', 'so far we have enjoyed it  the only problem we have is i have not been able

secretary', 'not perfect but very good a few times alexa picked up something from tv and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things if you call something 34light34 in the app you need to say light not 34lights34 echo plus has no problems as a smart hub but i could use better user directions well worth owning and a good step to making my home smart', 'pretty cool i have only begun to figure out things she does', 'i have the google home that i really like the echo plus i think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it', 'i love this device makes life easier the more you figure out it can do', 'i love my echo plus i havent one bad thing to say it controller music when i need it too with a great sounding 360 speaker i also bought a 4k fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment the included hue lighting makes this product even better i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer alexa will controll it all as soon as you say hey alexa and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort', 'amazon music is great love the ability to create my only playlists has great sound not up to the standard of our bose but very good', 'home entertainment', 'great product i just wish it had some sort of equalizer the bass is a little much', 'its work perfect an i must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions', 'i decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the echo plus to control it  i chose a kwikset 888 because amazon said it was compatible and i bought 2 dots while i was at it  and when i posed the question somebody in the community said it will work with alexa  what i didnt know was the zwave lock and zigbee alexa hub werent compatible  does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus  if not i guess my choices are 1 exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink  2 return the whole alexa system and get something elsei  dont want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or ill be back here asking how to integrate two hubsthe reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because i was afraid they wouldnt operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something doesnt work', 'this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life', 'i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub im in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hubs and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i havent even had time to go through all the skills it has but ive already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i wasnt even considering the echo in part because i didnt know it was a hub but also because i didnt really think i would find much use for another ai system if youre looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet costs the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb  saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top', 'im so happy that i purchased alexa  when i recently saw this at a friends home he played some music while talking about the product  i love the sound  love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question  she responds immediately  i havent been able to listen to my cds for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that its not an issue any longer', 'after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased with echo plus', 'i love it

turns on and off my light it can also dim them with voice commands i also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that i didn’t purchased  audibles for i like that it can play my music from amazon music pandora tunein i heart radio and spotify echo can even play my local radio station i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt this allows tivo to pause stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered  the only three dislikes that i have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond so i think they need to improve the microphone and i wish the speaker was better the speakers are okay but could be improved also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus this error was sorry i’m having trouble understanding you please try again later after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet and it was easy to find this out and i found it odd that my dot wasn’t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network', 'love everything about this', 'perfect for controlling my tplink smart devises', 'love this thing

enjoy the various functions of the device', 'alread had echos and dots but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on prime day  another fun product from amazon', 'i purchased the echo plus with the buildin hub so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off  philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great  i already had an echo dot in my kitchenden area so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tplink plugs  but the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus  i am able to play music set my alarm get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices  the echo dot requires a tplink plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work  the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and  the echo plus with hub  other than the high price of the bulbs i love my echo plus with built in hub', 'easily configured hub capabilities  excellent sound quality for the size of the unit', 'works

thing is awesome  i got it on prime day for a great deal  i wish i had purchased two  i also bought the echo show version but the sound is not nearly as good as the echo plus  the echo show came

really easy to set up i had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub but installation was easy and instructions were clear', 'really cool device that does a ton of stuff fun games like jeopardy we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges', 'i’ve been waiting for prime day to purchase an echo plus and now i’m enjoying learning what alexa can do with a new sonos one and an echo dot i have the makings of a really nice and wellintegrated smart home love it', 'i havent had it very long but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions', 'although this is my second echo device i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentationinstructions as to the many functions of the device  i purchased becausse of the sound quality but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident  there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device  or at least point out where it can be found', 'the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google but as a start on home automation she is very impressive', 'i never had alexa before but the biggest reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars its mostly youtubes fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist', 'awesome loving alexa', 'no habla espanol', 'love the music the stories', 'it is fantastic',

receive my cpr classical station  great soundwhat i like least is the learning curve and my mistakes', 'sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command  “alexa turn on the living room lights”  oops i mean “alexa turn on the family room lights” i also never realized i call my couch a sofa some times  unfortunately my alexa is confused by my changing names for where i sit', 'no it is broke and i cant get help fixing or replacing it', 'i’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature being able to play music check the weather etc is fine', 'sounds great have not used the hub yet', 'is as expected and more responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands', 'sound is better',

taken advantage of many of the echos features there is one that bothers me it starts talking even when i havent said anything even close to the wake up word  echo  had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device', 'the echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use  it plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things  still learning what all it can do  working very well so far', 'we have used for last 2 weeks we like it my children also like it alexa has become part of our family', 'terrible stopped working after one day', 'better sound than my echo dot simple

thing i can do', 'great product', 'like it still working discovery really too soon to fully evaluate but looking forward to learning and using it', 'when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbswhat i didnt realize and also wasnt fully communicated to me is that you cant use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for medo not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointlessi still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device im only disappointed with the hubs functionalities', 'still needs some work on commands sound is equal in the regular echo so if you dont need a smart hub get a regular echo the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear', 'i love my echo plus i use it with my spotify account to find my phone make phone calls  turn our lights off and on much more most importantly it reads story to my children  they love it and that makes me happy', 'excellent why didn’t i think it is in the beginning i love it', 'bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge  took a little tinkering had to rest the individual bulbs but works great no more 34philips hue bridge is not responding34 message', 'works great exactly as described only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff', 'i love it use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from', 'very easy to hook up download the app and it walks you through the setup', 'i am so disappointed in this product  i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed  hours with amazon technicians resetting each of them  the app didnt connect the echo plus to the internet connection  tried using the application on a phone a tablet and on a chromebook no luck  there are no clean directions on the application  probably sending this back to amazonmark this as not ready for prime time', 'well behaved device that i enjoy using', 'easy setup and sound quality', 'i really love the hub feature', 'what a blast  we love echo  just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too', 'love this', 'great sound quality works well with smart home devices', 'use way more often than we used our google home', 'mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result', 'nice add on to a homewhat i dont like are the limitations for example world soccer it wont give you much info of sport teams other than american', 'i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap im no audiophile by any means so maybe its that but i think it sounds great considering the size it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear i havent had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands i have it paired to an ecobee3 my firestick and a phillips hue light bulb i plan on adding devices as i go i love this thing and im glad i scooped it up i have only had it around 2 weeks will update if i run into issues', 'i love my echo plus the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors', 'great device my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me', 'the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work i was not aware of that  disappointed', 'the echo plus is great so easy to set up and with the built in hub it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command i am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks definitely recommend the echo plus', 'works as advertised it says alexa is always learning thats great because i am just learning all the things alexa can do', 'great  love it', 'wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item', 'doesnt seem to hear as well as my 2nd generation echo and why is there no volume buttons on it', 'a', 'worked great the built in hub works great', 'it knows everything  we ask it to do havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase sound quality is excellent also', 'connecting and sound are perfect i only give 4 because the is no internal battery if i disconnect to the power source it will be off', 'it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer  we admit that we have not explored all thats available through the echo  one irritating issue is that alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer  it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful', 'i like how easy it was to set up very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices', 'ease of use and many tasks it will perform', 'i purchased the echo plus with builtin hub during prime days sale it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi also connected it to a smart plug to control a light i love telling alexa to play music and she hears me from 2 rooms away excited to learn new uses for it', 'it was harder to setup then i thought it should be for some reason i had to default  it twice had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices would be nice if it could interact with my xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras be nice set and disarm the alarm with alexa had to install a skill app to setup bulb  whats that about you ship it with your product  should have said alexa setup bulb or alexa find new bulb  and alexa setup nest its fine that you use third party apps but alexa should do the work for you', 'nothing to dislike i love my new toy that has made my house a smart home', 'the built in hub lacks some of the features geo fencing of the phillips hub  otherwise would have given it 5 stars', 'the echo plus is used for leisure and pleasure i absolutely love it easy to set up and connect what a great addition to my listening pleasure i have not used it yet for other purposes', 'arrived right on time and works as expected', 'its like a remedial form of the star trek computer in your home', 'the echo part works fine  the hue hub is a disaster  it worked for a few months and then nothing  i spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one y to have to send it in for repair  i am now trying to reconnect my lights  what a pain  i am having to reset each light bulb  it can take up to 5 times to get it to reset  i have spent hours on this  i will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful  stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps', 'i love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too great for family game nights',

reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect it will be on its way back to amazon', 'this is the 3rd unit i purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well all my switches work great and i have had not issues i the past i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this it just keeps improving over time not with call capabilities i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest best way so far can’t wait to see what they come up with next', 'love it i play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy', 'i cant get multiple profiles working it just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt', 'i love it  using music and turning on and off light', 'it has great sound and very responsive to commands', 'this thing is great has good sound and does everything i expected i have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarmcom as well', 'no problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great', 'this is a very useful device  i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house  it works with all the other alexa devices so i can give a command near any of them and this will process the request  it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do i enjoy it much more than i thought i would', 'i love my echo plus', 'how can you not like the echo plus  it has the built in hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices  amazon makes a great product and i havent had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices echo dots etc', 'i have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics  however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music i can make calls and finally hear people when home i do not have cable only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations weather and other updates it was really great to hear i have linked all of my accounts to her she turns on my lights before i walk through the door she purchases reorders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not  this is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone  my tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her must buy', 'i love my echo plus and have cousins from italy here visiting and they love it  i want to give them each one however will it work for them in italy someone please answer my

calendar on my samsung phone through google cant get it to work', 'love this product', 'music news shopping list jokes games', 'works well need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well', 'ill be returning it  its been nothing but annoying  the hub cant be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge  i cant even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so  there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues  bottom line is it sucks as a hub  it doesnt support zwave and zigbee which in fairness i knew in advance but when the one protocol it does support doesnt do many functions that a dedicated one will whats the point  i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesnt  i found that rather interesting', 'the echo does not link to direct tv even though they said it would i have spent multiple hours on this made phone calls and texts also is missing free bulb', 'still learning what it can do amazing simple works right out of a box only frustration is getting amazon alexa app t show up on my

'great product easy to install and use not a necessity but a commodity', 'works great i bought this direct from amazon and i have got to tell you this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek i am a disabled person and it helps me turn light on and off and schedule doctor appointments using google voice phone and get my medical rides to and from hospitals plays music on cue from multiple web apps and watch videos as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off thank god no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights thank you amazon i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirmcom to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event really helped when all you earn a month is 672 on ssdi thank you all again', 'im sure the echo is as cool as everyone saysbut i wont get to try this one even though i have a large covered porchthe package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100 chance of rainand rain it did soaking the package im not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is this order has been cursed from the beginning ordered as a birthday gift and delivery was not made on scheduled day now i get it and its rainsoaked', 'so far i love it  it was easy to set up  if i can do it anybody can  speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command', 'i am not tec smart enough to make it work at all will send it back if i cant get help my eco dot works just fine this is too complacatedi just wanted a bigger speaker', 'we are a long time amazon prime family many years but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus with hub and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning verbalize books playing music on command even linked to my sirriusxm account good daily stuff good sound but not bose but the ads say 34hub included34 so dont need anything else to operate devices well not so i understand there will be some differences in product device  support the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on off dimming of the bulb the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge so it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes time the lights when you are away set color tones etc that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge was very disappointed to find that out after the fact to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs', 'i love it but does not play well with my amazon prime many shortcomings and potential fees', 'item as described and delivered on time  thank you', 'i bought 2 of these plus 2 echo dot 2nd generation on prime days love the echo plus easy to setup the reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free philips hue white a19 single led bulb works with amazon alexa there is no one to call to find out why', 'product does not  light bar never went orange  i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions i tried both  product is defective', 'exactly what i wanted with speedy shippingthank you so much', 'easy to install', 'i have an original echo and really like it i wanted another one for my basement i realize it isnt a huge stereo with settings but it doesnt sound bad at all definitely doesnt take up much room great price for the echo plus on prime day i ordered two', 'i bought this on prime day and saved lotsi have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that i used for years the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time very impressed with the clarity and volumeyou will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that’s just a sad fact it’ll play pandora and spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that it’s not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but i’ll be getting the dot which has an audio out jack as does the echo plus and just connect to external speakers', 'i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb  the excited ended quickly  i spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus  everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message  i tried to set this up over and over and over again  i watched youtube videos  i read set up websites  i was the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different resultsthe next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr and 19 mins of being on the phone it still didnt work  this product has tested my patience  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old schoolthe only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb  the problem wasnt the bulb because before packing up the items i purchased another bulb and still alexa couldnt locate this devicei pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo  the support person had the same thought  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i cant get over the look of that hub  it looks like a defuseri cant believe i didnt find youtube videos that show the problems i did  everything looked simple and seamlessnot the experience i had  ok im done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already', 'got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event it sounds pretty good and works well so far', 'very nice and its does not take up space', 'im an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and ive always loved it i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice as much as i love my original echo the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that its got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus', 'received the wrong productwas so excited to install it all excitement gone thank you amazon', 'i’m having trouble with it the alarm most of times doesn’t work the timer doesn’t ends and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable', 'love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription', 'sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub  the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs', 'i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub as many folks already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i dont really need the hub with less functionality in addition i dont think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs net net for me this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good with the  original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these', 'why do we need to buy a 100 hub to get it to work with samsung tvs and many other devices  i want my money back  this thing wont even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub  whats the point of having a hub that doesnt support half the devices out there  dont buy this thing unless you want to spend another 100 on another hub  it wont work with many of your devices  just by the echo or dot if you must but not this  better yet get a google device  they actually understand you when you talk', 'i love it in my living room', 'absolutely love it  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable  when playing  music with  bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs', 'i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb  when i got everything set up i realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb  all it does is turn the light onoff and dim  it will not change colors  you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb  i wish i’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights', 'at a volume setting of half or less the speaker sounds like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it  id understand if the volume was set higher  all speakers get distorted when overdriven  but this doesnt sound like this is an overdriven case sounds like more of a rattlecrackle  possibly because the bass is too high  learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics other than volume  i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem', 'the sound is fantastic for the classic  music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top but also you can tell  34alexa volume 334', 'love alexa makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time', 'i was suppose to get the “free” lightbulb with purchase it did not come with echo upon reading more carefully it says to click a box to receive free bulb  of course i want the free bulb who wouldn’t just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many “ free”  bulbs away disappointed  i have yet to set up my echo our first purchase on any alexia device debating if we want to keep it it did come quickly with my prime membership', 'i bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work it isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall it should’ve been more clear when i bought it', 'alexa helps with more than just lights or music it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  sweet  love it  so much so i purchased 2 alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself when i got it he wasnt so keen on it but now its his best friend he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day as well as sang him happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it and to think i was going to hate it', 'incredible piece of technologyi have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing its no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons on the echo 2 a large inconvenience and not as precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo 2nd generationthe piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it overthis order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do was say 34alexa connect my devices34 the default names for each bulb was assigned as 34first light34 and 34second light34 so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned onoff one of the lights by saying 34alexa turn off the second light34 in the alexa app i created a group with 34first light34 and 34second light34 and named the group 34the light34 so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say 34alexa turn on the light34i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i was surprised by that awesomeyou will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few 34skills34 like thunderstorm sounds and quote of the day  alexa always loads them up quickly adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great featurei can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownershipi was lucky to buy this for 100 on prime day but i think for 150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only 100 in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you1 taller and 360 sound unit2 volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over buttons3 built in hub for hue bulbs after researching more there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups for me and my floor lamp its just perfecti highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now', 'easy to install very clear speaker i took one star off because it was delivered late by ontraclike usual', 'love love love', 'good product', 'i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smells but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up 3xs now to no avail i have 4 other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly i have reset my phone galaxy s8 checked the app for updates i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the networktechnology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured 3xs was enough it shouldnt be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technologyi hope they wont call me ill tell em to send the product back', 'pretty cool device still have a lot to learn but im changing channels on my fios and getting info needed the speaker is great for what i needed it for which mainly is music', 'unit came with the wrong plug will have to send back to amazon', 'love it', 'the sound quality is really quite good i also have a dot which is bluetooth linked to a grace digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing snell speakers obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much my only complaint is that you cant customize alexa hot words now that i have multiple alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an alexa command to a particular device i would like to be able to talk to a device by name', 'love the light bulb feature', 'the echo plus works as expected but i never received the philips hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase please advise', 'very nice everything is working fine just have to 100 learn the commands', 'the sound quality is great it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen', 'just got mine last night played around with it for a while should have bought it a long time ago', 'so easy to use nonstop music', 'great product and prime day price took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other echo devices in my home this came with a philips smart bulb its better than having a clapper i found instructions online to wake to music  philips light very easy to set it up with the instructions you even have an option of what song you want to wake up to', 'exchange new color', 'alexa is the best smart speaker out there im so glad i came across it the sound is so amazing and i mostly use amazon alexa for music and school work help i love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend', 'it get on sale after 2 days so  check events before u buy these amazon products', 'pros plenty loud for a large room with high ceilingscons  the hub doesn’t do anything  it doesn’t work with z wave as it states it doesn’t take voice commands for smartthings which i had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z waveit also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the eq not sure if that is on all models but the dots we have are clearfor the money buy an echo dot or echo 2nd generation  the echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub go figure and the audio is clear the dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper', 'alexa is a decent speaker if thats all you need she is terrible at most other things she consistently answers questions that were not asked or says 34hmmm i dont know that34 for everything else weve gone back to just using our phones because she cant really look anything up pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when i had an awesome bose bluetooth already i bought her because my mother who lives alone uses hers a lot and is happy with it but we have a full house with kids and im less than impressed id never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall', 'the setup of this device was simple and effective  i am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of alexa  this is great for my mobility issues  i now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family', 'perfect', 'we love it bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily', 'alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations last night i was asking a sibling why they are using alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs then the echo dot downstairs starting singing “oh technology oh technology” kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own', 'love love love my amazon echo plus', 'the sound quality is not that good especially for the price that you pay for this i would recommend to get the echo dot and buy a better speaker instead maybe sonos and use the echo dot', 'alexa was able to call my phone when i couldn’t find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded  then i came home a day later and it wouldn’t turn on the light but would shut it off  then she said i had no devices couldn’t find my phone  now working again  we will see  love the selection of music', 'i will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible with my lifetime amazon spending approaching nearly 40000 i’m sure i’m just a small customer to them but i’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of amazon purchasesi have 8 echos for home automation and bought this echo plus specifically for the builtin hub along with approximately 600 in zigbee light switches the voice control is subpar even when it works and that is a rarity most often it does nothing i could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the amazonzigbee ecosystem if you value your money and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere', 'i love alexa she works great but she not for little children she doesnt understand if you dont speak clearly she fun to have', 'holy sound quality batman this thing jams its insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around', 'very easy to set up and use slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart

girlfriend in white and i wish i had it in white now alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when its not around i find new uses for alexa every day ive incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life as alexa learns more i learn more shes my alarm clock she reminds me of important dates im constantly asking her for information like travel entertainment science history politics etc she turns on and off lights shes the core of my smart home', 'i love it best gift i got myself', 'i love the sound very good we use it for home automation also works well', 'i

my original echo', 'the sound of the speaker is better than the other echo i own', 'im loving my easy access to all the music and books i listen to from amazon music and audible  the treble mid and

alexa devices', 'it appears to be working fine my first echo stopped replying to my requests and i received the echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange', 'this is the best amazon speaker with alexa in it  but if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell alexa to turn them on and off that’s it you’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices', 'still trying to link to my sons and daughters in their rooms', 'didn’t really work as smooth as they make it seem like', 'it does

plus with builtin hub  black amazon', 'good product i like it  thank you', 'its louder than the dot and its got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house', 'easy set up', 'was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review the one challenge with the hub is that phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub basic functionality works with this unit but now i need two apps to set everything how i want it instead of one which has caused some user issues its woken up a couple times without the trigger word which i find highly unsettling we have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly but its usually just one or two repeats if that happensthe speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchenliving room the sleek design is not obtrusive my girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and weve had entertaining conversations with it', 'works great', 'very happy', 'love this device', 'i really like this item i already had the echo dot but with this purchase the philips hue bulb came with the plus just purchasing the plus i have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else i use that with

remember the information so far this has been a huge success with my classes and i look forward to amazon improving and building out the blueprints skill further', 'this is a great tool toy roomfilling music very convenient to use just fun to have why only 4 stars supposed to work with logitech harmony remote nope supposed to work with denon av receivers nope this may not be amazont

amazing sound', 'i love the echo plus mainly because i dont have to worry about putting a cd in to play i just command a song and it plays however i was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the echo after consulting with amazon and learning that i can purchase a portable echo charging station im goodsincerely', 'we love this', 'as an echo its great good sound quality and functionality as a smart home hub it sucks no automation no geofencing no music syncing for hue no zwave all it does is turn things on with your voice ended up buying a smartthing hub and

brought it over the google home', 'great', 'got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updatesit’s far from being usefulhalf the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off basically ignoring you often she is unable

television needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy instructions were short and easy to follow i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area but thought id wait and see glad i did wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far a few brief hiccups here and there but im convinced that was from the apps themselves dont miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price which right now is a total of 50 a month amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows so far it hasnt been any issue at all the upcoming fall tv schedule which includes the return of nfl football might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often ill worry about that then my only real

on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i cant use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both 24ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works its very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had

work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through its little rough patch and i havent had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo

out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service couldnt help they basically told me to contact

well i’m a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people  entering your wifi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no thirdparty app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled', 'great product', 'very helpful for playing music setting alarms and talking to you when you are lonely', 'easy to set up can control kasa smart plugs no problem

sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom its perfect i dont have any problems

are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots', 'i really love my dots so awesome how it’s connects all my rooms but like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i’m sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots

funciones tales como el tiempohorainformación de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet', 'for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error first i didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker don’t lastly i’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “alexa”', 'i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with itsuch as set a timer a reminder play music and games i dont like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things it was also very difficult to set up the directions made it sound as simple as one two three but they forgot about step four five and six i was almost ready to send to backthe app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think its an ok item', 'love the echo dot it’s amaxing', 'i like to use it for listening to podcasts  i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me whats new  the one thing i dont like was getting it to recognize the radio

compound in size however it  projects very good sound it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound i also like it size because its not awkward and

but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound', 'i was really happy with my original echo so i thought id get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device', 'listens well does way more than expected love her', 'we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and wont turn them on but weve been able to manage and fix it i mean its convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc  im just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now', 'works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions', 'small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected

its a great value', 'i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just didnt work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound', 'i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini cant do  it works well', 'this is so much fun to play with  i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of  alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial  i havent used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts', 'easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase', 'a great product for the price works well', 'perfect for a home office', 'weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad

our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house', 'so far so good  not to tech savvy so im still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so

34spying34 on us', 'not connected to my phone playlist', 'i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer this has been a godsend 100 we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speakerstereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you wont regret this at all', 'perfect  fast shipment and packaging  worked as intended', 'alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time', 'love it', 'im addicted to this thing', 'i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it im just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesnt take up a whole lot of space', 'so far alli can say is i love it', 'love my dots  easy to use  i have two plus the echo spot  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music  amazon iheart radio pandora', 'great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home', 'im obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you', 'works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers', 'easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do', 'we have so much fun with this  so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa', 'i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done', 'we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price', 'super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time it’s great for my news updates too', 'it works just like my other dots', 'set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use', 'the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality  a massive difference from the alexa  which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswon’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve', 'i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine', 'i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder', 'too soon im still learning what i can do with it', 'enjoying it and still learning all the commands

order it', 'i love this technology im older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room', 'use as my 3rd dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesnt have access to phone', 'amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do', 'does what i expected and more', 'the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has  and even that one has bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it', 'i have a friend now', 'it’s easier to do things with it', 'good device', 'overall love it there are just some commands which arent effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom

i needed', 'love it i personally prefer spotify music so it’s great that i was able to set that as default there’s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away it’s a must have', 'love it  it works great  alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day  im not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine  not perfect but good', 'this  is my second

complaint i have is that the sound quality isnt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a

and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i cant use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both 24ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works its very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know', 'i got this for dad on fathers

rocks', 'i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot however the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through its little rough patch and i havent had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device', 'small size works great in our sunroom', 'i like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon', 'i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service couldnt help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist  so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set

she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that', 'luv it  its a great product', 'what can i say well i’m a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people  entering your wifi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no thirdparty app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled', 'great product', 'very helpful for playing music

sleep sounds i got this product as a gift for my kids and they love her too she is great for reading time and timing 30 minutes for itthe only thing i really dont like is that she has to be plugged in

tell me a short story lol its pretty fun i know some people complained about the speaker im not sure why im sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom its perfect i dont have any problems with the speaker love everything about it', 'wish volume was capable of going louder', 'i love it', 'best purchase this year', 'i love these i have 2 dots and one echo for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots', 'i really love my dots so awesome how it’s connects all my rooms but like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i’m sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echostill totally love them and would recommend 100',

had to buy speakers too', 'like having the music where ever i am', 'hard to hear had to blue tooth it to a better speaker', 'no problems works as expected could have a better speaker', 'i love it i

installing', 'un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como el tiempohorainformación de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet', 'for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error first i didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker don’t lastly i’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “alexa”', 'i love this product so far only because of the

have installed', 'totally gets out sense of humour', 'we put one in the bedroom  it plays music and tells us the weather  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning  it is better than a clock

sure about the dot  i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model  i havent decided if ill keep it or not', 'love

the house i already have the regular echo  the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound', 'i was really happy with my original echo so i thought id get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device', 'listens well does way more than expected love her', 'we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and wont turn them on but weve been able to manage and fix it i mean its convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc  im just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now', 'works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions', 'small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker', 'alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity  though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers', 'small footprint  nice clarity', 'easy set up', 'great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and infodot speaker is not as strong as the base but its a great value', 'i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just didnt work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound', 'i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini cant do  it works well', 'this is so much fun to play with  i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of  alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial  i havent used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts', 'easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase', 'a great product for the price works well', 'perfect for a home office', 'weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get two you need prime

kind of music  i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another', 'love the dot', 'great item  im so glad i made the purchase and on prime day', 'im still learning how to use it  i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus', 'love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house', 'so far so good  not to tech savvy so im still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use  lots of apps that it can use  i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have', 'echo dot responds to us when we arent even talking to it ive unplugged it it feels like its 34spying34 on us', 'not connected to my phone playlist', 'i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer this has been a godsend 100 we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speakerstereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you wont regret this at all', 'perfect  fast shipment and packaging  worked as intended', 'alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time', 'love it', 'im addicted to this thing', 'i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it im just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesnt take up a whole lot of space', 'so far alli can say is i love it', 'love my dots  easy to use  i have two plus the echo spot  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music  amazon iheart radio pandora', 'great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home', 'im obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you', 'works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers', 'easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do', 'we have so much fun with this  so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa', 'i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done', 'we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price', 'super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time it’s great for my news updates too', 'it works just like my other dots', 'set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use', 'the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality  a massive difference from the alexa  which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswon’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve', 'i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine', 'i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder', 'too soon im still learning what i can do with it', 'enjoying it and still learning all the commands  ran into one frustrating issue  it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household', 'i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices', 'works great', 'i like almost everything', 'amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine', 'my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions', 'great

upstairs bedroom', 'got to love alexa she does everything around our house', 'works great and easy to set up', 'my 3rd echo device very easy to set up works perfectly', 'easy to set up and start using

expected this is our fourth one our son loves it in his room easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it', 'love it', 'dislike the volume it does not sound loud enough', 'love alexa  i own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit', 'as expected', 'i didn’t order it', 'i love this technology im older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room', 'use as my 3rd dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesnt have access to phone', 'amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do', 'does what i expected and more', 'the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has  and even that one has bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it', 'i have a friend now', 'it’s easier to do things with it', 'good device', 'overall love it there are just some commands which arent effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked', 'these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we wouldnt be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs', 'works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices', 'i love it it is just what i thought it would be  im addicted', 'works beautifully excellent sound', 'still learning everything she can do  good for a room  volume is pretty good without an additional speaker', 'neat tool we enjoy it with the family', 'easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot', 'i live alone this is the best companion', 'easy to set up and connect with smart devices just what i needed', 'love it i personally prefer spotify music so it’s great that i was able to set that as default there’s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away it’s a must have', 'love it  it works great  alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day  im not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine  not perfect but good', 'this  is my second echo to purchase  the price was so cheap  im seriously thinking of buying 2 more  i use 34alexa34 for everything  its the next best thing to the internet', 'i love it bought one for my daughter and one for myself', 'it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be', 'i enjoy it still discovering new uses',

product is easy to use and very entertaining  i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so', 'works great but speaker is not the good for music will need to get a bluetooth speaker', 'outstanding product  easy to use  works great', 'we have six of these throughout our home and they are great  there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening  there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command 34alexa34 or 34computer34 are a little annoying  more colors then black and white would also be a good thing', 'use the product for music and it’s great', 'easy to setup and to use', 'it works great', 'i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting', 'phenomenal', 'i loved it does exactly what it says', 'i used it to control my smart home devices works great', 'very convenient', 'este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor

listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems', 'only complaint i have is that the sound quality isnt great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and dont mind the audio quality but if youre bothered by that kind of thing id go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers', 'good']\n"
